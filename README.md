# value_iteration2: real-time value iteration planner package for ROS 2

a monolithic mobile robot navigation system as a replacement for the navigation stack
this branch is value_iteration2 with A* (2s) version

* ROS 1 version: https://github.com/ryuichiueda/value_iteration
* with A\* algorithm version: https://github.com/kei487/value_iteration2/tree/feature/withastar2d

## How to try

```bash
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-grid-map*
$ sudo apt install ... (I will write later about required packages. )
$ cd <workspace>
$ git clone https://github.com/ryuichiueda/emcl2_ros2.git #Please use this version due to a problem of launch file.
$ git clone https://github.com/kei487/value_iteration2_astar_msgs.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ryuichiueda/value_iteration2.git
$ cd <workspace>
$ colcon build
$ source install/setup.bash
$ source install/local_setup.bash
$ ros2 launch value_iteration2 turtle.launch.py
```

## Nodes

### vi_node

This node executes value iteration.

#### how to execute value iteration

Give the goal to topic `/goal_pose`. The planner immediately starts working and giving the velocity of the robot through `/cmd_vel`. The action server is not implemented in this stage.

#### Services Called

* static_map ([nav_msgs/srv/GetMap](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/nav_msgs/srv/GetMap.html))
    * Initiate the map for value iteration.

#### Subscribed Topics

* goal_pose ([geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped.html))
    * goal position and orientation
* scan ([sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan.html))
    * laser scans
* tf ([tf2_msgs/msg/tfMessage](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/tf2_msgs/msg/TFMessage.html))
    * transforms

#### Published Topics

* /cmd_vel ([geometry_msgs/msg/Twist](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.html))
    * the control order to the robot; published only when the parameter `online` is true

#### Parameters

* action_list (still not imported from ROS 1)
    * Currently, `vi_node` requires an action list like the following. `onestep_forward_m` and `onestep_rotation_deg` mean the forward and rotational velocities respectively. `vi_node` calculates the optimal value function and the oplimal policy based on this action list.

```
  <rosparam> <!-- in the case of ROS 1 -->
    vi_node:
      action_list:
        - name: forward
          onestep_forward_m: 0.3
          onestep_rotation_deg: 0.0
        - name: back
          onestep_forward_m: -0.2
          onestep_rotation_deg: 0.0
        - name: right
          onestep_forward_m: 0.0
          onestep_rotation_deg: -20.0
        - name: left
          onestep_forward_m: 0.0
          onestep_rotation_deg: 20.0
  </rosparam>
```

* ~online (bool, defalut: true)
    * flag for using vi_node as a real-time planner
* ~theta_cell_num (int, default: 60) 
    * number of intervals of the discrete state space on theta-axis
* ~global_thread_num (int, default: 2) 
    * number of threads used on value iteration
* ~goal_margin_radius (double, default: 0.2[m]) 
    * radius of the goal on xy-plane
* ~goal_margin_theta (int, default: 10[deg]) 
    * radius of the goal on theta-axis
* ~map_type (string, "cost" or "occupancy", default: occupancy, "cost" is not imported to this version) 
    * choice of map for setting immediate costs and occupancy (please read the Maps section)

#### Maps

We can choose two types of maps for initializing parametes of states. 

##### occupancy mode: 

A cost map is created from an occupancy grid map. Occupied cells are marked as roped-off area. Moreover, cells near occupied ones are given immediate penalty. The near cells and the value of the penalty are controlled through the following parametes. 

* parapeters
    * ~safety_radius (double, default: 0.2[m]) 
        * distance that should be kept between the center of the robot and an occupancy grid 
    * ~safety_radius_penalty (double, default: 30[s], max: 1,000,000,000[s]) 
        * immediate penality (negative immediate reward in the field of reinforcement learning) when the robot invades the safety radius. 

##### cost mode (still not imported to this version):

We can also use a "cost map," which contains the immediate cost of every cell. This map should be written with "[Raw mode](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server#Raw)". In a map, cells given 255 are regarded as roped-off cells. Cells with other values are free cells but are given the values as their immediate costs. 

There are an information file (`cost.yaml`) and a map file (`cost.pgm`) in the `maps` directory. The information file must contains the line `mode: raw` as shown below.

```
image: ./cost.pgm
resolution: 0.050000
origin: [-10.000000, -10.000000, 0.000000]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65 #not used
free_thresh: 0.196    #not used
mode: raw
```

`vi_node` reads a cost map from a service `cost_map`. In `launch/vi_turtle_online.launch`, you can find the following lines so as to provice the cost map through `cost_map`. 

```
  <node pkg="map_server" name="cost_map" type="map_server" args="$(find value_iteration)/maps/cost.yaml">
    <remap from="static_map" to="cost_map" />
    <remap from="map" to="cost_map_for_vi" />  <!-- This line avoids this node to provide the map to RViz. -->
  </node>
```

## Notes

### What's the cost means?

It is the sum of costs from a pose (position + orientation) to a point of goal. The cost means the time. Therefore, it means the time required to reach the goal if immediate penarties don't exist. As shown in the parameter list, we can define some kinds of immediate penalties, which are quantified in units of seconds.
